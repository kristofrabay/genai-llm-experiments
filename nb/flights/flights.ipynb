At a major rally in Budapest, Magyar spoke to thousands of supporters, presenting himself as the primary challenger to Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and his long-standing Fidesz party government.\n",

      "Key points from Péter Magyar’s campaign and recent statements:\n",
      "\n",
      "- He openly criticized Viktor Orbán for moving Hungary away from democratic values and for fostering closer relationships with autocratic countries like Russia and China, instead of strengthening Hungary’s Western alliances.\n",
      "- Magyar pledged that if elected in the 2026 parliamentary elections, he would prioritize restoring Hungary’s standing as a reliable NATO ally and a committed member of the European Union. He argues that Orbán’s policies have been isolating Hungary and eroding its democratic institutions.\n",
      "- Magyar’s message has resonated especially with voters dissatisfied with the status quo and concerned with democratic backsliding, government corruption, and increasing authoritarianism.\n",
      "- His campaign emphasizes values like transparency, rule of law, European integration, and a pro-Western foreign policy orientation.\n",
      "- Magyar has also committed to reversing legislation that undermines civil liberties, such as recent restrictions on LGBTQ+ rights and government control of the media.\n",
      "\n",
      "Magyar's rise comes amidst growing frustration over domestic policies and Hungary’s increasingly fraught relationships with the EU and other Western partners. His party’s growing popularity is seen as a sign that Orbán may face a tougher challenge in the next elections than in previous years.\n",

      "  - He continues to highlight care for the environment, referencing the climate crisis and urging world leaders to prioritize ecological justice in advance of international climate talks.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Upcoming Plans**:\n",
      "  - The Vatican reports that Pope Francis is preparing a new encyclical focusing on artificial intelligence’s ethical implications, expected to be published later this year.\n",
      "  - Although he has postponed most foreign trips, the Pope plans to attend the 2025 Jubilee celebrations in Rome, a major Catholic Holy Year event with millions of pilgrims expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Vatican Politics**:\n",
      "  - There is ongoing speculation about Pope Francis’s possible retirement amid health concerns. However, the Vatican has not confirmed any official plans; the Pope himself recently reaffirmed his commitment to continue as long as his health allows.\n",
      "\n",

      "- **Typical low-cost options:** Up to about 67,000–70,000 HUF (Ryanair, direct, departs 20:10)\n",
      "- **Standard full-service or with a stop:** From ~123,400 HUF (KLM, with stop), typical full-service airlines (Lufthansa, KLM, Air France): ~120,000–140,000 HUF\n",
      "- **Premium/flexible fares or very short/long connections:** Can be as high as 180,000–190,000 HUF\n",

      "    - Brussels Airlines: Various flights (usually with a stop, e.g., via Brussels), 183,400 HUF and up.\n",
      "    - Aegean, Air France, or other flags: Often similar pricing for flexible tickets.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Highlights\n",
      "- The **cheapest and most convenient** is the direct Wizz Air flight (afternoon), followed closely by a later Ryanair direct evening flight.\n",

      "Great question! The short answer: For most travelers flying from Budapest (BUD) to Madrid (MAD), paying nearly double (or more) for a full-service airline versus a low-cost carrier is often not worth it for a relatively short 2–3.5 hour flight—unless you have specific needs or preferences. Let’s break it down:\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Why Low-Cost Airlines (Wizz Air, Ryanair) Are Often the Best Value\n",
      "\n",
      "**Direct, quick, and cheap:**\n",
      "- Wizz Air: 59,580 HUF, 3.5h direct, afternoon\n",
      "- Ryanair: 67,244 HUF, 3h 20m direct, evening\n",
      "\n",
      "**What you get:**\n",
      "- Basic ticket: Usually just the seat, with meals, checked baggage, or seat selection as extras\n",
      "- Great if you pack light and value getting there quickly\n",
      "\n",
      "**Pros:**\n",
      "- Fast and simple\n",
      "- Saves 60,000–130,000 HUF versus full-service\n",
      "- More flights are direct\n",
      "\n",
      "**Cons:**\n",
      "- Extra fees for checked bags, seat selection, or food/drink\n",
      "- Stricter change/cancellation rules\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### When Paying More for Full-Service Makes Sense\n",
      "\n",
      "**Typical full-service and flexible options:**   \n",
      "- KLM, Lufthansa, Brussels (prices ~123,000–183,000+ HUF with 1 stop)\n",
      "\n",
      "**What you get:**\n",
      "- Free checked bag (often 1)\n",
      "- Meals/snacks\n",
      "- More flexible ticket (changes, cancellations easier—sometimes free for premium)\n",
      "- More comfortable seats, priority boarding, better frequent flyer rewards\n",
      "\n",
      "**Worth it if you:**\n",
      "- Need flexibility/change options or refunds (work/medical/family reasons)\n",
      "- Are carrying multiple/heavy bags (e.g., checked and a large carry-on)\n",
      "- Are loyal to an alliance (Star Alliance, SkyTeam, etc.)\n",
      "- Value lounge access (some premium/class fares)\n",
      "- Price difference is small (occasionally, premium fares are discounted, though not for your date)\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### The Reality for Most People\n",
      "\n",
      "On a 2–3.5 hour flight, the **core experience doesn't change much**—you’re sitting on a plane for about 3 hours. Here’s when the higher price makes sense:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Business travel**: Need flexibility or company covers cost\n",
      "- **Worried about cancellations/changes?**: Full-service perks can bail you out, and they may rebook you more smoothly if things go wrong\n",
      "- **Big luggage needs**: Sometimes the total price (fare + baggage on low-cost vs. included with full-service) narrows the difference\n",
      "- **Points junkie/elite frequent flyer:** You want to keep status, upgrades, or accumulate miles\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're traveling for leisure, dates are fixed, and you travel light, **stick with low-cost direct flights and pay for only the extras you actually need**. Book early for the best price.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Bottom Line\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Price-conscious, light packer, no schedule worries:** Go with Wizz Air or Ryanair.\n",
      "- **Need flexibility, extras, or loyalty benefits?** Full-service might be justified—but check alternate dates for sales first.\n",
      "- **For most leisure flyers:** Opting for low-cost will almost always give you the best value on this route.\n",
      "\n",
      "**If you want to compare total cost including bags and seat selection, I can help you calculate. Just let me know!**\n",
