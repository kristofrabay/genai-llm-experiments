    "#### Components\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Very similar to Responses API - actually built on it.\n",
    "    - Arguments (important ones):\n",
    "        - `instructions` - developer/system message. Can also be dynamic with a function that takes as input the context and reads from it to fill a prompt template\n",
    "        - `tools` - custom and built-in\n",
    "        - `output_type` - structured output objects\n",
    "        - `handoff_description` - description of the agent. This is used when the agent is used as a handoff, so that an LLM knows what it does and when to invoke it.\n",
    "    - Run them via the `Runner` class (async by default)\n",
    "        - handles e2e flow - no manual tool execution or handoff is needed. it is done once reached a `final_output` return\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Tools\n",
    "    - built in (Hosted) tools (web search, file search, computer use)\n",
    "    - custom tools - `function–tool` decorator - turn functions (well defined!) into JSON schemas\n",
    "    - agents can also be used as tools - important difference: Handoff: entire convo goes to new agent. Tool: only the output is passed to the new agent to execute it and hands it back\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Handoffs\n",
    "    - basically sub-agents (technically tools / functions) that are being called when an agent-to-agent handoff should happen\n",
    "    - in handoffs, the new agent receives the **entire conversation history**, tools (or agents-as-tools) **only receive the generated output**\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Output types ~ Structured outputs\n",
    "    - pydantic Baseclasses passed to agent under `output_type`\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Context\n",
    "    - dataclass that is passed to all agents, handoffs, tools\n",
    "    - everyone can read from it, fill prompt templates, pass parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Additionals\n",
    "    1. Guardrails\n",
    "    2. Lifecycle events (hooks)"
